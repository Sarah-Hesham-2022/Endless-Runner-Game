# Endless-Runner
Unity and C# for Game Programming 

-Android Application Game built to be used on android version >= 7 .

-A simple Endless Runner Game, where a 3D character keeps running infintely.

-The lane is divided into 3 parts ( left, middle, right) .

-The user can touch (swap) the character into one of these lanes' areas.

-Animation transition appears when the game starts, as the character is standing and then suddenly starts running, also when game over it stops running.

-You can move character to left, right or up (making it jump) .

-When character jumps ,some distance in the z-axis is covered, so it keeps running while jumping, it doesn't jump in its place, the character is always running unitl game over .

-This helps to skip the part where there are 3 cubes after each other (Maximum) , if more you have to skip that lane.

-The barriers here are 3D cubes, if once touched (collision occurs) , it is game over.

-Cubes should be avoided by changing lanes' areas or simply jumping over them without collision.

-The user experience UX here appears in this part, where after getting to play the game multiple times, the user himself will be able to sense the perfect time to jump without game over, the user will be able to detect the perfect distance between the character and the cube/s in order to jump.

-There are coins appearing on the way ,each coin is worth 10 points .

-Accumulative Score is calculated as long as the game is going .

-There is a pause button, where you can pause the game and get back to it at the same exact state you left.

-Exit button to shut down the game.

-Info button, repersenting simple basic story telling of the game.

-Particles are implemented ,can be seen as the character is running ,representing the friction force with the ground.

-Also, particles appear when the character collides(collects) a coin.

-Sound effects added.
